    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    This key must be generated for the actual app you are building.

    Follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Or (with Google Play Services SDK installed) generate a file with a link to use by using:
    File -> New -> Google -> Google Maps Activity

    Note, you need a separate key for debug and release, set in src/debug and src/release

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
